## What is Ethernet?

- a method of networking
- unarguably the world’s **most widely-used** connectivity technology
- signals and wiring at the physical layer & MAC packets and protocols at the data link layer.
- uses CSMA/CD

## What is CSMA/CD?

- stands for **'Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection'**
- 'Listen before Talk'
- transmits frame on a network

## Procedure of CSMA/CD communication

1. **[Carrier Sense]** A PC or server checks if someone is using the network's resource.
2. If a carrier's detected, it holds sending the frame onto the network.
3. It starts transmitting its frame if there's no other PC or server transmitting.
4. **[Multiple Access]** Collision occurs if multiple frames are uploaded at the same time. Then the host sends a ‘jamming signal’ to inform other stations of the collision. 
5. **[Collision Detection]** The PC or server stops transmitting and waits for a random amount of time(*random backoff period*) until the problem's solved.
6. It restarts the transmission of the frame.

## Collision Domain

All four hosts are connected to a hub. If one PC is transmitting its frame and the network's busy, all other PCs will not be able to transmit their frames. 
If a collision occurs in that network, all of the PCs will be affected. They are in one 'collision domain'.
CSMA/CD had developed to protect the collision.  

## Bridge & Switch

While hubs have the risk of collision, bridge and switch can separate collision domains.

In this regard, PCs connected to the switch can communicate with each other even though other PCs are on transmission.
